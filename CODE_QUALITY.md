Code quality rules:
- functions/methods: use camelCase (e.g isValid).
- variables: use camelCase (e.g isValid).
- Classes/Models/Types/Interfaces: use PascalCase (e.g Room)
- Constants: use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for global constants.
- explicit naming: use descriptive, yet clear names
- early returns: use guard clauses to reduce nesting depth.
- immutability: prefer const over let/var where possible.
- single responsibility: each function should do exactly one thing.
- error handling: implement robust error handling with standardized error messages.
- comments: if you add comments, add them on top of function/class declarations, keep them simple, yet informative.

Prefer modular, testable, scalable, easy to read and understand code over complex structures.
